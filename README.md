# Intro

## User Stories

Capital City is for users who want to test their knowledge about the capital cities of various countries worldwide.

A user of the application wants to

- easily start and view the instructions for the game
- understand easily the purpose of the application
- have clear instructions what to do and how to use the application
- have instructions and guidance while playing the game
- be presented different questions (a different capital city guess) when playing the game
- wants to play the game again once a guessing round is completed

- requirement to validate user input


# Design & Flow of logic
                                            
The design of the game is limited. The user interface is text-based based on the command-line application developed with Python. Since the game is terminal-based, no images such as .jpg or other image formats can be used.

The logo of Capital City, represented by the Eiffel Tower, is displayed using ASCII
art. The stages of the game are displayed with multiline strings.

## Flowchart                                       
    								        
A flowchart was prepared in the planning phase and developed alongside the coding of the command-line application. The flowchart was created with **[Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/)**

Feature 2: Ask for playername
User eiter enters player name or not. Input is validated. No user input results in default name assigned to user.

# Technologies

**[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** Visual Studio Code (VS-Code)was used as integrated development environment for the entire project. The GitHub repository was cloned to VS-Code for this purpose

**[GitHub](https://github.com/)** The code files, README files and assets are stored on GitHub. The code on GitHub was pushed from Git

**[Git](https://git-scm.com/)** The version control system Git was used to document the development of the application and to push code to the GitHub repository. The specific reasons for the commit are reflected in the respective commit message
            
**[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)** Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) to build, run, and operate applications cloud-based. It was used to deploy the website

**[Lucid Chart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/)** Lucid Chart is a web-based diagramming tool to create flowcharts, wireframes, and visualisations of concepts

**[CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)** The Code Institute Python Linter was used to validate python code

**[Python](https://www.python.org/)** Python is an interpreted, high-level and general purpose programming language

**[ASCII Art Generator](https://emojicombos.com/eiffel-tower-ascii-art)** ASCII art generator for image of Eiffel tower
       




### Libraries and python built-in modules used

**[sys](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html)** sys was used for system-specific functions such as exit()

**[Random Module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html)** The random module was used to pick a random capital city from a list of cities

**[Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/)** Installed with pip install colorama. Used to change colors of UI

**[Time](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html)** time was used to create typewriter effects


# Testing

1. Validator Testing	
    
    **[CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)** The Code Institute Python Linter was used to validate python code and conformity to PEP8 style guide
    
    Some warnings on code lines slightly too long resulting from use of variable names that might be slightly too long but more explanatory in nature (conflict of variable name being self explanatory versus maximum line length)

2. Validator Testing	
    
    **[Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/overview?hl=de)** 
    
    Lighthouse was used to check the website performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO
