# Design & Flow of logic
                                            
The design of the game is limited. The user interface is text-based based on the command-line application developed with Python. Since the game is terminal-based, no images such as .jpg or other image formats can be used.

The logo of Capital City, represented by the Eiffel Tower, is displayed using ASCII
art. The stages of the game are displayed with multiline strings.

A flowchart was prepared in the planning phase and developed alongside the coding of the command-line application. The flowchart was created with **[Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/)**
